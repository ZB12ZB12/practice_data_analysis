Introduction (in English):

Since MLB launched the "statcast" system in 2015, thousands of pieces of field data have been recorded every season, allowing teams and baseball enthusiasts to analyze and discuss these data.
I am no exception. I have been following baseball for 13 years. Taking advantage of the mid-semester courses that were also related to data analysis, I conducted a series of courses on the topic of "Analyzing the pitching strategies of major league pitchers in different situations." Data processing, new advanced attributes, and analysis.
The results showed that this question was actually too broad, and the results did not show which pitching strategy was more obvious; perhaps it would be better to analyze the behavior of individual pitchers later.

中文介紹：

自2015，MLB啟用"statcast"系統至今，每年賽季都記錄了成千上萬筆的賽場數據，可供各球隊、愛棒球的有志者對這些數據進行分析、討論。
我自己也不例外，關注棒球運動已長達13年，趁著學期中的課程也跟數據分析有關，便以"分析大聯盟投手的在不同情境下的投球策略"為題進行了一系列的資料處理、新增進階屬性、分析。
而結果顯示，這個題目其實訂得太大，結果並沒有特別顯現出那一種投策略較為明顯；或許之後改以個別投手的做為分析較佳。
